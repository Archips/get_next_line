# Get Next Line

This project involves creating a C function, `get_next_line`, that reads lines from a file descriptor. The function should return each line one at a time upon repeated calls.

## Project Highlights

- Efficiently reads lines from a file descriptor
- Uses static variables for improved performance
- Optional bonus part for handling multiple file descriptors

## Usage

1. Include the provided header file, `get_next_line.h`, in your C program.
2. Call the `get_next_line` function with the file descriptor you want to read from as an argument.
3. The function will return each line from the file one at a time until there are no more lines to read or an error occurs.
4. Make sure to manage memory properly and handle errors as needed in your code.
